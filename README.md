# Library-Management
This project is configured to compare the performance of linked lists and hash tables for managing libraries in the C programming language. We implemented library manipulation functions using linked lists initially, then utilizing hash tables, aiming to compare their performance in terms of execution time.
# Usage
To compile and run the project:
make all && ./test (or ./test1 or ./test2)
